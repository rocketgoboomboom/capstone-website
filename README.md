# CMU MHCI NASA Capstone 2024 Website

## Purpose

The goal of the website is to describe the entirety of the project and explain how it creates value for out stakeholders at NASA. 

This site incorporates all of our research from primary research done with NASA stakeholders to analogous domain research that discussed adjacent problems and our solution to the issues of evaluating anomalies in deep space travel.

## Team
We are a team of Master of Human-Computer Interaction students at Carnegie Mellon University, and we are building a system that allows NASA researchers to see how their research is impacted in the presence of an anomaly.
